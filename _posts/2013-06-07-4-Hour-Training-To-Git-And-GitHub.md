_Developers training on GIT @cticdakar par Thomas Sarlandie (@sarfata). With @peopleinput @seysoo @samaevent @afriqueitnews @esmt & others! &mdash; Yann Le Beux (@YannLeBeux)_

Git is an awesome tool and I have not met a developer who went through the learning curve and regreted it. Combined with GitHub (or a similar service), it is even more helpful and everyone should learn how to use it.

I think in most developer groups (user-groups, companies, schools, etc) there is at least one developer who has some experience with Git. Taking the time to show to his/her fellows how to jump into Git is often the best way to get them started but most do not have the time to prepare a full training.

With [those slides][4hggt], available under the Creative Commons license, I hope that many developers will take the time to organize a small training for their friends and colleagues so that everyone joins the fun!

## The full story

A few weeks ago, we organized a [5 nights training session for mobile developers][demtraining] in Senegal. We started with some jQuery Mobile to get everyone on the same base and then spent most of the time looking at everything else: ui/ux design, agile practices, testing and collaborative tools.

This last session on Git and GitHub turned out to be extremely successful and in just four hours I managed to get everyone in the room to learn the basic commands and start using GitHub.

The main exercise had them create a personal homepage on GitHub with GH Pages and then clone his/her left-neighbor's homepage to add a link to his/her own page. We ended up with a ring (old-school!) of interconnected homepages for all the student. This was really fun.

I think we managed to show the best parts of git: useful locally to the developer, easy collaboration, free project sharing, and free web hosting through github (which is a big thing here in Senegal - There are not that many options to host pages for cheap when you do not have a credit card).

Of course we did not cover every concepts but they can learn the rest on Google.

## The Four hour Git and GitHub training

Based on this first experience, I re-packaged those slides in a new slide-deck called "4 hour git and github training" that is available under the CC-BY-SA license. Anyone can use them to share some Git love with their co-workers, friends, etc. I tried them yesterday morning with a new group of 18 people and it worked great again!

So if you know just a bit about Git ad GitHub, [please fork the slides][4hggt], get some developers together and start sharing! Let's put an end to zip files collaboration and source code lost due to disk problems!
