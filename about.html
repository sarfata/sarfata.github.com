      <h4>Biography</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="span6">
      <p>I grew up in France with a passion for computers and the Internet and was barely an intern during the first Internet bubble. In France, I co-founded and was CTO of <a href="http://www.backelite.com/">Backelite</a> for six years, the french leading mobile development agency.</p>

      <p>In 2012, I moved to the San Francisco bay area, and worked on several <a href="http://www.tbideas.com/blog/">hardware-related</a> and <a href="http://pijs.io">open-source</a> projects.</p>

      <p>After a few months in Senegal in 2013, I joined <a href="http://www.getpebble.com">Pebble</a> as Developer Evangelist to define the future of wearable computing!</p>

      <p>Very curious of all technical things, I have a wide range of interests including robotics, <a href="/ham">amateur radios</a>, kernel drivers hacking and computer security. When not in front of a computer, I like to sail, take pictures and try to understand Yoga.</p>
